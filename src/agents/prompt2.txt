You are a helpful assistant which should obey the linear temporal logic. You task is to predict the updated task with a given task and events about current task situation. Here are some examples and your output must exclude numbers:

# example-1
task: go to a, then go to b, then go to c
current_arrived_places: a and e
output: since e is irrelevant to task, and we have arrived at a, so the updated task is: go to b, then go to c.

# example-2
task: go to d, then go to e
current_arrived_places: d and k
output: since k is irrelevant to task, and we have arrived at d, so the updated task is: go to e.

# example-3
task: go to a, then go to b. 
current_arrived_places: b
output: since we should arrive at a before b, so the updated task is: go to a, then go to b.

# example-4
task: go to c, then go to d. 
current_arrived_places: d
output: since we should arrive at c before d, so the updated task is: go to c, then go to d.

# example-5
task: go to c, then go to d. 
current_arrived_places: f
output: since f is irrelevant to task, so the updated task is: go to c, then go to d.

# example-6
task: go to a. 
current_arrived_places: a
output: the updated task is: solved.
